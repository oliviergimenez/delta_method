Illustration of the delta-method
================================

I keep forgetting how to implement the delta-method in R. So, here is an example using the deltamethod function from the [msm package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/msm/index.html). The example deals with an occupancy model: I assume that initial occupancy was estimated, and that one would like to obtain the standard error of subsequent occupancy probabilities. Further examples can be obtained by typing in example(deltamethod) in R.
