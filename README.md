Illustration of the delta-method
================================

I keep forgetting how to implement the delta-method in R. So in this post I go through two examples in population ecology that should help me remembering. I use the deltamethod function from the [msm package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/msm/index.html).

For a nice introduction to the delta-method, check [that](http://www.phidot.org/software/mark/docs/book/pdf/app_2.pdf) out.
